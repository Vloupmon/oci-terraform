# oci-terraform
Terraform conf to deploy an always-free VM.Standard.A1.Flex instance on OCI

Includes a 4 vCPUs, 24GB RAM instance + firewall rules for my own Caddy setup.

Partially based on an example provided by Oracle @ https://github.com/oracle/terraform-provider-oci/blob/master/examples/always_free/main.tf
